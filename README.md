# Storyblok Sync TUI

Storyblok Sync is a terminal user interface (TUI) that synchronises Stories and Folders between two Storyblok spaces. It allows users to scan source and target spaces, select content, preview collisions and apply changes.

- Environment flags reference: [docs/env.md](./docs/env.md)

## Features

- Scan source and target spaces and list stories with metadata.
- Mark individual stories or entire folders for synchronisation.
- Fuzzy search over name, slug and path.
- Preflight collision check with per-item skip or overwrite decisions.
- Sync engine that creates or updates stories in the target space with progress and error reporting.
- Rescan at any time to refresh space data.
- Prefix filter for listing/selection only (no bulk "starts-with" execution).

## User Flow

1. **Welcome/Auth** – enter a token or load it from `~/.sbrc`.
2. **SpaceSelect** – choose source and target spaces.
3. **Scanning** – fetch stories for both spaces.
4. **BrowseList** – navigate and mark stories.
5. **Preflight** – review collisions and choose actions.
6. **Syncing** – apply the sync plan.
7. **Report** – see which items succeeded or failed.

Interrupts: `r` to rescan, `q` to abort.

## Status

- v1.0: Functional and stable TUI for syncing Stories and Folders between Storyblok spaces. Implemented flow: auth, space selection, scan, browse with search, preflight, sync with retries, and final report. Logging is available via `DEBUG` to `debug.log`.

## TODO (Next Steps)

1. [Robust rate limiting & retries](./docs/PLANNING.md)

   - Detect HTTP 429 and parse `Retry-After` in `sb.Client`.
   - Centralize exponential backoff with jitter; honor context cancel.
   - Add tests for backoff, header parsing, and transient errors.

2. Interactive Diff & Merge View (Preflight)

   - Screen/state: add a Diff view for colliding stories with side‑by‑side source/target.
   - Data: fetch full raw payloads; normalize; ignore read‑only fields; focus on `content` + slugs.
   - Diff engine: recursive JSON diff for maps/arrays; match arrays by `_uid` when present; mark add/remove/modify.
   - UI: collapsible per field, collapse unchanged by default; expand changed; keyboard to pick source/target per field; accept‑all‑left/right, search by path; help overlay.
   - Merge: build merged JSON, validate minimal invariants, store decision for the item, feed merged payload into sync.
   - Tests: diff correctness on maps/arrays, large payload performance (bench/light tests), decision persistence.

3. RichText preview

   - Detect RichText fields (root `type=doc`) in story content.
   - Add preview toggle in Diff and Browse: raw JSON vs rendered preview.
   - Implement minimal renderer (paragraphs, headings, bold/italic, links, lists); truncate long blocks with expand.
   - Sanitize/link handling; no external fetches; keep it fast and safe.
   - Tests with fixtures under `testdata/` for common node types and edge cases.

4. UX improvements

   - Publish state UI: show publish/unpublished badge in lists; in Preflight allow per‑item publish toggle (stories only), defaulting from source + plan policy; persist in plan and respect during sync.
   - Per‑item progress, pause/cancel, clearer error surfacing in Sync view.
   - Persist browse collapse across screens; snapshot tests.

5. Performance & caching

   - Bounded worker pool + token-bucket rate limiter.
   - Reuse `ContentManager` more broadly; add simple metrics.
   - Concurrency tests with deterministic ordering.

6. Security & logging

   - Redact tokens; avoid logging large payloads by default.
   - Structured logs with levels; audit for accidental secrets.

7. CI & releases

   - GitHub Actions: `go fmt/vet/test` + `staticcheck` on PRs.
   - Goreleaser for multi-arch binaries; release notes template.

8. Dry-run mode (low priority)

   - Core: no-op write layer that still produces full reports.
   - UI toggle; clear messaging in Report view.
   - Tests verifying zero write calls and identical plan.

9. Component sync (low priority)

- Mode toggle: switch between Stories and Components in the UI.
- API: extend client to list/get/create/update components; handle groups and display names.
- Browse/search: fuzzy search by name, group, and schema keys; filter by group.
- Collision check: detect name/group conflicts and schema diffs.
- Diff/merge: JSON schema diff with collapse/expand; highlight breaking changes (type, required, enum shrink).
- Dependencies: resolve nested component references; compute sync order; warn on missing dependencies.
- Safety/validation: block breaking changes by default or gate behind confirmation; optional dry‑run validator to check impact on existing stories.
- Backups: export target component schemas before overwrite; store under `testdata/` or timestamped snapshots.
- Tests: fixtures for components and dependency graphs; diff and ordering tests.

The sync core has been extracted to `internal/core/sync`. Future modules (`infra`) will house infrastructure helpers described in the roadmap. For a deeper dive into responsibilities and data flow, see [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
